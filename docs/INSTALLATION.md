## 1. Required Parts

### Shopping List

| Part | Description | Approximate Price |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32 Board | e.g. D1 Mini ESP32, ESP32-DevKit | ~5-10 EUR |
| CC1101 Module | 868 MHz recommended for Europe | ~3-5 EUR |
| Dupont Wires | 7x female-to-female | ~2 EUR |
| USB Cable | Micro-USB or USB-C (depending on board) | usually on hand |
| Elero Remote Control | e.g. TempoTel 2 (already owned) | - |

> **Tip:** 868 MHz CC1101 modules have significantly better range than 433 MHz. Use 868 MHz if possible.

### Tools

- Computer with a USB port
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Internet access

## 2. Hardware Assembly

### Step 2.1: Connect CC1101 to ESP32

Connect the pins as follows using Dupont wires:

```
CC1101          ESP32 (Standard-Pinout)
──────          ──────────────────────
VCC  ──────>    3V3  (3.3 Volt!)
GND  ──────>    GND
SCK  ──────>    GPIO18
MOSI ──────>    GPIO23
MISO ──────>    GPIO19
CSN  ──────>    GPIO5
GDO0 ──────>    GPIO26
```

> **WARNING:** The CC1101 operates at **3.3V**. Never connect it to 5V!

### Step 2.2: Verify Wiring

Double-check all connections:
- No loose wires
- No short circuits between adjacent pins
- VCC connected to 3.3V (not 5V!)

### Step 2.3: Connect ESP32 to PC

Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB. The driver should install automatically.

## 3. Installing ESPHome

### Option A: ESPHome Dashboard (Home Assistant Add-on)

1. In Home Assistant: **Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store**
2. Search for "ESPHome"
3. Install and start
4. Open the ESPHome Dashboard

### Option B: ESPHome CLI (Command Line)

```bash
# Python and pip must be installed
pip install esphome

# Verify it works
esphome version
```

---

## 4. Initial Setup: Testing the Frequency

Before configuring the blind controls, you need to make sure the CC1101 communication is working.

### Step 4.1: Create the Base Configuration

Create the file `elero-blinds.yaml`:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: elero-blinds
  friendly_name: "Elero Rollladen"

esp32:
  board: esp32dev

wifi:
  ssid: "YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
  password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"

  ap:
    ssid: "Elero-Fallback"
    password: "fallback123"

logger:
  level: DEBUG

api:
  encryption:
    key: "GenerateThisKeyViaESPHomeDashboard"

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    password: "YourOTAPassword"

# External Elero component
external_components:
  - source: github://manuschillerdev/esphome-elero

# SPI bus
spi:
  clk_pin: GPIO18
  mosi_pin: GPIO23
  miso_pin: GPIO19

# Elero Hub - default frequency
elero:
  cs_pin: GPIO5
  gdo0_pin: GPIO26

# Web UI for device discovery
web_server_base:
  port: 80

elero_web:
```

### Step 4.2: Flash for the First Time

**Via CLI:**
```bash
# Initial flash over USB
esphome run elero-blinds.yaml
```

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Create a new configuration
2. Paste the YAML
3. Click "Install" > "Plug into this computer"

### Step 4.3: Test the Frequency

1. Open the ESPHome log:
   ```bash
   esphome logs elero-blinds.yaml
   ```
2. Press a button on your Elero remote control
3. **If packets appear in the log** (lines containing `rcv'd: len=...`): The frequency is correct!
4. **If NOTHING happens**: The frequency needs to be adjusted.

### Step 4.4: Adjust the Frequency (if needed)

Change the frequency registers in your configuration:

```yaml
elero:
  cs_pin: GPIO5
  gdo0_pin: GPIO26
  freq0: 0xc0    # Common alternative instead of 0x7a
  freq1: 0x71
  freq2: 0x21
```

Flash again and test. Common combinations:

| Configuration | freq0 | freq1 | freq2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard 868 MHz | `0x7a` | `0x71` | `0x21` |
| Alternative 868 MHz | `0xc0` | `0x71` | `0x21` |

> **Tip:** Try `0xc0` first -- it is the most common alternative.

## 5. Discovering Blind Addresses

Open the web UI at `http://<device-ip>/elero`:

1. Operate your physical Elero remote control (Up/Down/Stop).
2. The web UI shows all received RF packets in real time.
3. Newly seen blind/remote addresses appear as "Discovered" entries.
4. Click **Save** on each device you want HA to control. They're persisted
   to NVS and surfaced via your chosen output adapter.

The key fields from the RF packets (these are filled in automatically when
you save a discovered device):

| RF field | NVS field | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `src` | `src_address` | Address of the remote control |
| `dst` | `dst_address` | Address of the blind |
| `ch`  | `channel`     | RF channel |

---

## 6. Final Configuration

Devices are no longer YAML-defined — only the hub and the output adapter live in YAML:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: elero-blinds
  friendly_name: "Elero Rollladen"

esp32:
  board: esp32dev

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

  ap:
    ssid: "Elero-Fallback"
    password: !secret ap_password

logger:
  level: INFO    # Use DEBUG only when troubleshooting

api:
  encryption:
    key: !secret api_key

ota:
  - platform: esphome
    password: !secret ota_password

external_components:
  - source: github://manuschillerdev/esphome-elero

spi:
  clk_pin: GPIO18
  mosi_pin: GPIO23
  miso_pin: GPIO19

elero:
  cs_pin: GPIO5
  gdo0_pin: GPIO26
  freq0: 0xc0     # Adjust if needed
  freq1: 0x71
  freq2: 0x21

# ── Output adapter (pick exactly one) ──
elero_nvs:        # ESPHome native API + NVS device persistence
# elero_mqtt:     # Or: MQTT HA discovery (requires `mqtt:` + broker)

# ── Web UI (device CRUD, RF discovery, backup/restore) ──
web_server_base:
  port: 80

elero_web:
```

Flash:

```bash
uv run esphome run elero-blinds.yaml
```

After it boots, open `http://<device-ip>/elero` and add your blinds via the UI.

## 7. Adding to Home Assistant

### Automatic Discovery

If `api:` is configured, the device will be discovered automatically in Home Assistant:

1. **Settings > Devices & Services**
2. The ESPHome device should appear under "Discovered"
3. Click "Configure"

### Manual Setup

If the device is not found automatically:

1. **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**
2. Search for "ESPHome"
3. Enter the IP address of the ESP32 (shown in the log)
4. Enter the API key

### Verify Entities

After adding a device through the web UI, the following entities appear in HA (names derived from the device's `name` field):

- `cover.<name>` — Blind control
- `sensor.<name>_rssi` — Signal strength
- `text_sensor.<name>_status` — Status text

> **Native API mode** (`elero_nvs:`): adding/removing devices via the web UI requires a reboot for HA to see them — the UI prompts you. **MQTT mode** (`elero_mqtt:`): HA picks up changes immediately.

---

## 8. Adding Multiple Blinds

Just repeat the discovery + save flow in the web UI for each blind. The device automatically staggers polling requests (5-second offset per blind) to avoid RF collisions, and the 48-slot NVS pool is large enough for all reasonable households.

To migrate from older versions where blinds were defined in YAML, see [`MIGRATION-yaml-to-nvs.md`](MIGRATION-yaml-to-nvs.md).
